This project has a login and register page designed with object-oriented and MVC. In addition, I designed a small hacked CMS that can perform the four main CRUD database operations, given that each user can only edit or delete their own articles.

for execute app:
move "mvcproject" folder to "htdocs" folder in xampp
if xampp has error for run app, use wamp and move folder to "www" folder on wamp 
import mvc.sql to phpMyAdmin (username=root, empty password)
for connect to database change database config from config.php in "app/config"
